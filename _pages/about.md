Welcome:

I currently work as an Engineering Manager at Facebook, Seattle. Previously I worked as a Software Engineer at Microsoft.

I was born in Andhra Pradesh, India and lived there for 2 decades before moving to the United States to pursue Masters at NC State.

After finishing graduate studies, I moved to Seattle, Washington and have been living here since 2008.

I love the pacific northwest but hate the rain!

Other than work, I like hiking, Visiting new places, Driving, Cooking, Sushi, Movies, Music, Reading Fiction etc.

I have a twin brother, Vinod and an elder sister, Vandana. I'm married to a wonderful woman, Upasana.

We recently welcomed our 1st child Vaaryan aka Yuvi in 2017.

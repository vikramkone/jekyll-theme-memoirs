This is one of my favorite pasta recipes. Itâ€™s super easy to make and takes less than 30 min's. Made some changes to the recipe I found online.

Ingredients

Penne Pasta - 1 lb.

Ground Chicken - 1lb

Half n Half - 2 cups (Substitute with Whipped/Heavy cream if you are a brave soul)

Taco bell Taco seasoning Mix - 1.25 Oz

Green onions - 5 no's - chopped into small pieces

Garlic cloves - 5 no's - minced

Cheddar cheese

Tomatoes - 1 large - cut into small pieces

Olive Oil

Bell Peppers - 2 no's - chopped into 2" pieces

Directions:

Boil Penne pasta in water with 2 tsps. of salt and 2 teaspoons of olive oil for 15-20mins. Don't over boil it.

While it's boiling, in a bowl, mix ground chicken and the taco seasoning mix. Add some salt and red chilli powder if you want it spicy. Keep the mix aside.

In a sauce pan, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and fry minced garlic and bell peppers till they soften.

Now add the ground chicken mix to the pan and fry it for 10-15 mins covering it with a lid.

Drain the pasta in a colander and soak it in cold water for 30 secs. This makes the pasta less soggy!

Add half and half to the sauce pan and stir in the drained pasta. Cover for 5 mins.

Garnish with chopped tomatoes, green onions and cheddar cheese.

Serve with 2 pieces of California sour dough bread on the side :)

Enjoy!

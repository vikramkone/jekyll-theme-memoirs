2011 is here. Cant believe its almost end of the decade. A new decade now begins..I'm hoping 2011 will be more awesomer than 2010. As it happens with every new year, I made some new resolutions this time around too..

1. Ditch iPhone (go WP7) :)

2. Build my personal website  (this one...check )

3. Play badminton more regularly

4. Spend less time on facebook (yeah right :)...)

I guess I will be spending a lot more time on my blog this coming year..!
